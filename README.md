# Hospital-Emergency-Analytics-Power-BI-Project-


## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard** in Power BI to analyze patient data, optimize operations, and generate insights for better hospital management.

The solution helps stakeholders track **patient admissions, wait times, referrals, satisfaction scores, and demographics** to improve decision-making and service quality.

## 🎯 Business Requirements
- **Number of Patients**: Track daily ER visits and trends.
- **Average Wait Time**: Monitor patient wait times to identify delays.
- **Patient Satisfaction Score**: Analyze service quality trends.
- **Patient Referrals**: Track department referrals to optimize resource allocation.

## 📊 Dashboards Developed
1. **Monthly View**
   - Admission status (admitted vs. non-admitted)  
   - Age distribution by 10-year intervals  
   - Department referrals trend  
   - Timeliness (% patients seen within 30 minutes)  
   - Gender & Race analysis  
   - Day/Hour-based patient traffic  

2. **Consolidated View**
   - Holistic hospital performance for any date range  
   - Aggregated KPIs and trends  

3. **Patient Details**
   - Patient-level grid with details: ID, Name, Age, Gender, Race, Wait Time, Department, Admission Status  

4. **Key Takeaways**
   - Insights, anomalies, and recommendations for optimizing ER operations
